Probably not. Unless you have been explicitly taught what components make up a “smart” question, it’s common to be asking questions that can be improved significantly for the asker and the asked. Eric Raymond’s, “How to ask questions the smart way,” provides a clear and reasonable concise guide to ensuring the next question you post online is in the form of a right one. Now, is this considered the “right” way of asking questions? It depends on the audience in which you are asking the question. When it comes to asking about scholarly content on an online source, it's best to post a question that experts in the field don't scoff at. 

## Calling all software engineers
It is absolutely necessary to understand and practice how to ask questions the smart way for those who are software engineers. This should be second nature as you will undoubtedly need to ask a question on some online source and/or in a professional setting. Not only does practicing Raymond's guidelines avoid making you lose respect as a software engineer (sometimes even as a person, depending on how bad it was), but it also creates a thread that is easy to follow. This is vital to getting back helpful and quick solutions because there won't be wasted response time going back and forth trying to explain the issue or repetitive solutions you have already tried out yourself. 

## An eye-roller example
StackOverflow is used for programming-related questions where snippets of code are often used. The following question and StackOverflow link are asking for advice on how to learn concepts. Notice that even though the user is asking about concepts related to programming, there is no reference to actual code or how to implement an ideology into a project. In fact, it's a question that can be answered in any environment where there exists someone who studied any topic. This results in only one response and it is a trivial answer, which is to read a book. There is no issue that needs to be resolved, rather, only studying advice is concerned. Raymond mentioned that it's important to know where to post questions, noting that StackOverflow is for questions about programming. The user asking the question also starts off by addressing that he is a “noob” when it comes to the concepts he is trying to learn. This was discussed in Raymond’s guide as “annoying” and serves as a distraction or deterrent for those writing responses. Rather than groveling, it’s better to state what you know and how you have approached the problem(s). 

## Appealing smarter than you actually are
Now we'll take a look at an entirely different question that off the bat gives a stronger scholarly attitude. The question, "Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?" hints that there is some deeper level of understanding that the user is trying to gain. It is then followed by a few code snippets that show what invoked this question. Following this, there are a few of their own ideas and approaches to answering the question. The reader of this forum can instantly tell that the user has put in effort to derive an answer and the reader is able to follow along easily as he uses formatting tools such as code blocks or links. There are numerous and lengthy responses to this question which shows that this user's question is being taken into serious consideration. Raymond highlights that the experts in the field will not be engaged unless they are genuinely interested in the topic in discussion. If experts are captivated by your question, that ensures an effective and thorough solution with a much quicker response time.

## Improvements on my own part
After reading Raymond's guide and analyzing some examples on StackOverflow, I've come to realize that there are multiple aspects I hadn't actualized. Most of these are related to format such as using accessible formats, using code blocks, setting up a Reply-To in the header of my mail agent, and others. It may have been the way Raymond speaks of those who ask "bad" questions, but now I've become more aware of the fact that the way one asks questions, reflects a reasonably accurate representation of that person's knowledge. Those who aim to ask questions that can be found through a simple Google search don't quite understand how valuable of a tool StackOverflow is. Those who, more or less, follow Raymond's guide understand and respect the fact that there are experts in the field shifting through these questions. If at the end of this article, you don't feel compelled to evaluate your own style of questions, there's a good chance you're in the former category of users (which I highly recommend getting away from).
