## Using FreeCodeCamp
I enjoyed going through the FreeCodeCamp tutorial and found it really helpful to require that the user completes the activity before moving on to the next problem. I also appreciated the solution pages because they gave me more insight when it came to solving a problem in a different way. Going through these lessons allowed me to grasp an understanding of Javascript and ES6.

## Java Background
I’m most familiar with Java as I’ve used it in my previous ICS courses and for my part-time job as a web developer. Javascript brings about really convenient features that would otherwise be considered impossible in Java. A significant difference is due to the fact that Javascript will treat functions as objects which enables the writer to pass in functions as parameters and other manipulations that aren’t available with Java. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned about this because, coming from a Java background, this was a concept I had only ever heard of a couple of times from my previous professor. I can find myself using Javascript as it makes the code much simpler and there are additional features compared to Java. I think this is a language that can benefit software developers because of in-line functions and operators. This will condense the code writing so that the writer doesn’t have to feel overwhelmed by too many lines, as I feel towards Java sometimes.

## First WOD
The WOD felt a bit pressurized as I had a partner that already solved the problem so we ended up watching me code alone. I don’t necessarily think that working with a partner for these problem-solving questions right off the bat is a method that works for me. I feel like we should maybe adjust the WOD so that students get a few minutes of alone time to think by themselves. Only after a few minutes should they be allowed to work with partners. I feel like this allows students to attempt the problem without feeling too nervous or, even, self-conscious if they aren’t confident in how to approach the problem. By working alone for a few minutes, it encourages students to practice thinking quickly, rather than relying on a partner to have the solution for them.
