## AI in Education
Access to AI has become more convenient with sites such as ChatGPT providing the service in a simple user interface that can be used by anyone who can create an account. AI makes it possible to input an assignment's prompt and output a simplified solution by taking in information from numerous articles. It can sculpt its answer in a clarifying and simple tone if instructed to do so. This makes it revolutionary in the eyes of a student who may be uncertain about how to approach their homework. A knowledgeable tool that can comprehend the human language is a tutor for students and those looking to learn about a new subject. When it comes to Software Engineering, AI can write code in all languages and suggest solutions for debugging procedures. Although it has been argued whether or not AI can "take over" Software Engineering positions, I believe humans are still a necessity because AI requires a "supervisor" who can point out where the errors are in code. This is especially true in large-scale projects that require previous knowledge of the structure that may be too complex to transfer to an AI model.

## Personal Experience with AI
For the ICS 314 course, I haven't used much AI help. 
1. Experience WODs: I haven't used AI. The instructional video usually clarifies any issues I encounter along the way.
2. In-class Practice WODs: I haven't used AI. If there were any problems, I could discuss them with my partner or call the instructor for further help.
3. In-class WODs: I have used AI to simplify the steps I need to take to convert HTML into React since I didn't study that particular content for that week.
4. Essays: I haven't used AI. I enjoy writing, especially reflections, as it lets me understand my thinking and realizations. I believe that's an important and precious skill to cater to.
5. Final project: I have used AI as a starting point for how to implement certain features. This is mainly because I find it hard to recall all the information we learned over the semester. Having a grounding point helps tremendously when it comes to the overwhelming feeling of not knowing where to begin and knowing there is a lot to accomplish within a short period.
6. Learning a concept/tutorial: I use AI in this way very often. I feel like it's a great tool to summarize a lot of Google searching and StackOverflow readings. 
7. Answering a question in class or Discord: I haven't used AI. I believe that answering questions should be a way to showcase one's character. Therefore I don't allow AI to modify my opinions or current state of knowledge when responding.
8. Asking or answering a "smart-question": I haven't used AI. I didn't ask or answer any "smart-questions" in class or Discord. 
9. Coding example: I have used AI for examples of new concepts presented in class. When learning the Underscore library, I did ask AI for examples of a few methods including the usage of .pluck and .map together.
10. Explaining code: I used AI for this especially when it comes to understanding the syntax of languages. For example, I asked AI to define HTML tags and their suggested times for usage. 
11. Writing code: I used AI for this in a few of the coding assignments that required a lot of UI work. I'm not too strong at how to set elements on the page in the way it is intended to look. That's why I use AI to clarify how to nest the tags, i.e. putting a "row" inside of a "container."
12. Documenting code: I haven't used AI. I don't have problems with writing documentation for my code because it's what I wrote and built. I wouldn't want to include any content that I don't fully understand. Regarding code comments, they help me to organize and structure my project so that I wouldn't get lost in my work. I also believe it's an important skill to have when working in teams where the code should be readable for all team members.
13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code”: I have used AI for quality assurance in the sense that I don't know what's "wrong" with my code. For the most part, it deals with trying to figure out the error with getting a component's intended logic to execute properly. 
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed: I don't have any other uses of AI in this course.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI technologies have enhanced my understanding of software engineering concepts. It's as if I can speak to an expert in any of the concepts I bring up and it can point out errors in my code or suggestions for making my code more efficient. It allows me to explore in-depth the various software engineering concepts without the endless tabs of searching through the Internet. Software Engineering is considered a difficult topic but with the help of AI, almost all of my questions have been answered. Whether that be the AI directly spotting the mistake or the suggestions it provides that lead me to it, AI has been beneficial for my learning.

## Practical Applications
I have used AI for my part-time Web App Developer position. I've used it primarily for debugging purposes because most of my work can be constructed from scratch as I have many examples of previous similar features to refer to. It's a great tool when working this job because I can run through steps of suggestions that will eventually lead to more knowledge about the issue and to an overall solution. AI can take in context as well, which speeds up the debugging process because it will provide relevant information for solving. This compared to searching the Internet where others have posted about _similar_ issues is a much more efficient way of going about it.

## Challenges and Opportunities
I've noticed that AI is a great tool when the user understands the topic or issue in discussion. However, it's difficult to comprehend when the user is a beginner in the concept. This is because the questions one asks when they are just starting in any field will be very general. Moreso, one is likely to ask a question that corresponds to something entirely different than what they thought it was to be. This is why I prefer to get a grounding point in any issue or topic because I use AI to dig further into the subject.

## Comparative Analysis
AI in the context of Software Engineering Education proves to be a very valuable tool for self-learning about classwork. Of course, the traditional teaching methods are just as important as I believe having an expert provide a curriculum sets the student up for success. I perceive AI as a library, a place that holds lots of knowledge but can only provide as much as the user may research. I do think that there's more engagement when one is self-driven because one is able to communicate with AI as if it were a human. This prompts students to be able to ask their "dumb" questions that may be strayed away from when speaking to peers or their instructors.

## Future Considerations
I’ve only benefited from the usage of AI in the context of software development. Therefore, I believe that AI will aid students and workers in improving their productivity as they will no longer need to “start from scratch” when it comes to implementing new features or projects. It will also be reassuring for many to know they would be able to discuss their questions with “someone” who will understand the context of their work without having to worry about asking simple questions. The only challenge to overcome would be that AI can only be helpful when the user has a strong understanding of the underlying issue or topic of discussion. This is just so that the responses that are AI-generated are checked for any errors that go against business rules. Which, in my opinion, isn't an issue for the use of AI but a challenge, generally, for any field.

## Conclusion
The usage of AI in Software Engineering courses should be appraised and promoted. It's just another resource that can be powerful in solving problems when one understands how to sculpt prompts to send. Analyzing the responses for any errors can also be seen as practicing problem-solving skills. Additionally, the use of AI also practices communication skills as one must send a descriptive and clear prompt in order to receive any helpful response. AI should be encouraged to guide those who are learning any subject because it is able to discuss common mistakes and point out errors worth knowing. I believe learning about common mistakes and understanding one's own errors is the greatest and most efficient way of learning any subject. After getting comfortable with its usage, one can achieve an A+ with AI!
