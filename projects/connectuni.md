ConnectUni is a mobile application designed for college students to connect in group chats and events through similar interests and classes. This idea is catered to Freshman and Transfer students because our team believed it is most difficult for these two groups to find their clique because of a new environment to get used to. The application enables users to create and join group chats and events, direct message other users, use a calendar to visualize their plans, and create a unique profile. We used Firebase as our database and authentication and the Flutter framework.

In this project, I was able to learn about the Flutter framework through various implementations:
- Creating the initial Login/Signup pages with manual authentication from Riverpod
- Standardizing mock databases (UserDB, MessagesDB, etc.)
- Ensuring routing works properly - enable a "back arrow" only when desired
- Fixing general bugs (EX: broken group chat page when a user leaves a group)

I was also able to learn about the deployment process as I was in charge of deploying our application to the Google Play store. It is currently released for testers only as our team wants to continue working on implementing more features before finally releasing it to the public.
