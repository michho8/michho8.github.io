As I near my software engineering class completion, I have come to appreciate that the course is not solely about web application development. While web development is indeed a crucial skill I've improved during this semester, the underlying goal of the course is to gain a deeper understanding of fundamental software engineering concepts. In this essay, I will reflect on what I've learned about software engineering in a broader context by diving into two key topics: coding standards through ESLint and design patterns. These concepts transcend web development and are relevant to computer science college students like myself.

## Coding Standards: ESLint
Coding standards are an essential part of software engineering, ensuring that code is consistently written, easy to read, and maintainable. In this course, I learned about ESLint, a popular tool used for enforcing coding standards in JavaScript. While ESLint's immediate application may seem confined to web development, its principles can be applied to various programming domains. Coding standards, also known as coding conventions or style guidelines, are a set of rules and practices that define how code should be written and formatted within a project. ESLint is a static code analysis tool that helps identify and fix code style issues and potential bugs in JavaScript.

### Beyond Web Development:
Code Maintainability: Proper coding standards enhance code maintainability. As a computer science student, I can see myself using ESLint or similar tools in non-web-related projects to ensure clean and organized code, making it easier to collaborate with teammates and future developers.
Cross-Language Application: While ESLint is specific to JavaScript, the concept of coding standards transcends languages. The principles of consistency and readability apply universally, allowing me to adopt similar tools in other programming languages, such as Pylint for Python or RuboCop for Ruby.

## Design Patterns
Design patterns represent proven solutions to recurring design problems in software development. While they are often associated with object-oriented programming, the knowledge of design patterns applies to other critical concepts for various applications beyond web development. Design patterns are reusable templates that provide solutions to common software design problems, guiding developers in creating maintainable and scalable software.

### Beyond Web Development:
Design patterns promote code reusability, a fundamental concept in software engineering. As a computer science student, I can apply design patterns in various programming paradigms, including functional programming, to efficient code. Design patterns are handy for algorithm design, helping me optimize and structure algorithms for problem-solving in various subjects such as data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Understanding design patterns ensures I have the skills to architect robust and scalable software systems, whether developing desktop applications, mobile apps, or embedded systems. In this way, software architecture becomes more apparent and less of a struggle to fulfill business rules while maintaining satisfied developers.

## A Successful Future In Software Engineering
The ICS 314 course has been a valuable experience that extends far beyond web application development. Coding standards, as exemplified by ESLint, and design patterns are two key concepts that have broader implications for those in the field of Computer Science. These concepts not only enhance code quality and maintainability but also empower me to tackle a wide range of software engineering challenges in diverse domains. As I progress in my academic and professional journey, I am confident that the knowledge gained in this course will continue to serve as a solid foundation for my career in software engineering.
