This "Catch 'em all" attitude-driven game was created to simulate the very basic functions of the famous Pokemon franchise. The user is able to discover different types of Pokemon that have varying combat power (CP) and health points (HP), as often recognized in Pokemon Go, and have a chance at "catching" the one on screen. The chances of success depend on the Pokemon, implemented as a `Java Object` which has various percentage rates. The user is also able to sort through a list of their "Caught" and "Seen" Pokemon, imitating a Pokedex.
