## Why create a framework?
There are many reasons why a framework may exist. However, it's widely agreed that frameworks are used with the intent of creating a universal and reusable software environment. With generic methods, this provides high flexibility for developers of all levels. I like to think of a framework as a "skeleton" that provides the support developers need to spend their time effectively. Moreover, they are able to spend more time thinking of their project's logical implementations rather than worrying about how to, in the web development sense, format the UI. Overall this means, I wouldn't need to worry about how to center my images using a lot of padding and margin customizations.

## Bootstrap 5
In my Software Development course, we are given coding tests called WODs ("Workout of the Day") that have a limited amount of time to complete. From the WODs we have done, there's an obvious reduction in CSS styles when incorporating [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/). As stated previously, there is no need to mess with the style sheet when moving an element to a specific section on the page. Instead, we can use rows and columns to have much easier control over the elements. Using the Bootstrap framework also reduces the time I use as the desired components are already provided. I wouldn't need to spend excess time rebuilding the desired output with raw CSS. The Bootstrap grid system, personally, makes a lot of sense. Learning the different classes of Bootstrap 5, I'm able to visually see how it can be used to recreate some websites. It's great that learning Bootstrap gave me a new perspective when it comes to building and formatting websites.

## Future usages
As my professional career advances, adapting to new frameworks not only allows me to be a flexible employee but also makes my job easier when it comes to catering to a particular project. Of course, a successful company will be using frameworks that speed up production time. This is because of how highly compatible a company's intended purposes align with a framework's services. I'm fulfilling somebody's wishes in the sense that a team of individuals must have spent quality time developing their framework's services. From a third-party perspective, why would you try to recreate the work of another if sharing resources is encouraged? Frameworks are available because their team wants others to be able to develop in an easier fashion, why not take that opportunity?
